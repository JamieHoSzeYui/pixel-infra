**I am** not responsible for bricked devices, dead batteries
thermonuclear war or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please
do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this package
before flashing it! **YOU** are choosing to make these modifications and if
you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you. Hard and a lot.
